MultipleChoice	Audio::Everything		What is the minimum recommended number of tiers in a multi-tiered VPC design?	Two tiers	"[ ""One tier"", ""Two tiers"", ""Three tiers"" ]"	At minimum, you should have two layers (tiers) of subnets within your VPC. The most common design includes web tier (public), application tier (private), and database tier (private).	Multi-tiered Architecture	Architecture aws_vpc Multi-tiered
MultipleChoice	Audio::Everything		What is a route table in AWS VPC?	A resource containing rules that tell network traffic where to go	"[ ""A security group that controls subnet access"", ""A network ACL that filters traffic at the subnet level"", ""A resource containing rules that tell network traffic where to go"" ]"	A route table is a resource within a VPC that contains rules (routes) that tell network traffic where to go. These work with the VPC router within your subnets.	Route Tables	aws_vpc Route Tables
MultipleChoice	Audio::Everything		What is the main route table?	The default route table created automatically with a VPC	"[ ""The default route table created automatically with a VPC"", ""A custom route table you create for public subnets"", ""A route table that only contains local routes"" ]"	The main route table is automatically created with your VPC and acts as the default route table for any subnets that are not specifically associated with a different route table. It's a catchall for routing.	Route Tables	aws_vpc Route Tables
MultipleChoice	Audio::Everything		What happens if you don't explicitly assign a route table to a subnet?	The main route table is assigned by default	"[ ""The main route table is assigned by default"", ""No routing is configured and traffic is blocked"", ""The subnet cannot be used until a route table is assigned"" ]"	If you don't explicitly assign a route table to a subnet, the main route table will be assigned by default. This is the catchall route table that comes with every VPC.	Route Tables	aws_vpc Route Tables
MultipleChoice	Audio::Everything		What is a Network Access Control List (NACL)?	A stateless firewall that controls traffic at the subnet level	"[ ""A stateful firewall at the resource level"", ""A stateless firewall that controls traffic at the subnet level"", ""A routing table that determines traffic paths"" ]"	A NACL is a stateless firewall that controls traffic at the subnet level. It allows or denies specific inbound or outbound traffic using numbered, prioritized rules where the first match wins.	NACLs	aws_vpc NACLs
MultipleChoice	Audio::Everything		At what level do NACLs operate?	Subnet level	"[ ""Resource level (EC2 instance level)"", ""VPC level"", ""Subnet level"" ]"	NACLs operate at the subnet level. They are assigned to subnets, not to individual resources like security groups.	NACLs	aws_vpc NACLs
MultipleChoice	Audio::Everything		What does stateless mean in the context of NACLs?	Inbound and outbound rules must be defined separately	"[ ""Inbound and outbound rules must be defined separately"", ""Rules are automatically applied in both directions"", ""Only inbound rules need to be defined"" ]"	Stateless means you must explicitly define both inbound and outbound traffic rules separately. They don't work together - each direction must be configured independently.	NACLs	aws_vpc NACLs
MultipleChoice	Audio::Everything		What is the default behavior of a newly created custom NACL?	Denies all traffic by default	"[ ""Allows all traffic by default"", ""Denies all traffic by default"", ""Allows only VPC internal traffic"" ]"	Any newly created NACL resource denies all traffic by default. You must explicitly allow any traffic that you want to be inbound or outbound.	NACLs	aws_vpc NACLs
MultipleChoice	Audio::Everything		How are NACL rules processed?	First match wins, processing stops at first match	"[ ""All rules are evaluated and the most restrictive wins"", ""Rules are processed randomly"", ""First match wins, processing stops at first match"" ]"	NACL rules are processed as an ascending numbered, prioritized list where the first match wins. Processing stops as soon as a matching rule is found, regardless of more specific rules that might come later.	NACLs	aws_vpc NACLs
MultipleChoice	Audio::Everything		What is an ephemeral port?	A short-lived random port (1024-65535) used for client-side connections	"[ ""A permanent port assigned to a server"", ""A short-lived random port (1024-65535) used for client-side connections"", ""A port reserved for AWS services"" ]"	"An ephemeral port is a short-lived transport protocol port that operating systems allocate for client-side transmissions when connecting to a server. These ports are random and fall within the range 1024 to 65535.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: 600;"">Example&nbsp;of&nbsp;an&nbsp;ephemeral&nbsp;port:</span>You&nbsp;(client) open&nbsp;a&nbsp;web&nbsp;browser&nbsp;and&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;<span style=""background-color: rgb(248, 248, 248); color: rgb(0, 95, 184);"">http://example.com</span>.<ul><li><span style=""font-weight: 600;"">Server</span>&nbsp;is&nbsp;listening&nbsp;on&nbsp;port&nbsp;<span style=""font-weight: 600;"">80</span>&nbsp;(HTTP).</li></ul><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: 600;"">Your&nbsp;computer</span>&nbsp;picks&nbsp;a&nbsp;random&nbsp;port in&nbsp;the range&nbsp;<span style=""font-weight: 600;"">1024–65535</span>, e.g.,&nbsp;<span style=""font-weight: 600;"">port&nbsp;49152</span>.</li></ul>So, the&nbsp;TCP connection is:<ul><li><span style=""font-weight: 600;"">Source:</span>&nbsp;192.168.1.2:49152&nbsp;(your&nbsp;computer, ephemeral port)</li></ul><ul><li><span style=""font-weight: 600;"">Destination:</span>&nbsp;93.184.216.34:80 (example.com, HTTP&nbsp;port)</li></ul>When&nbsp;the&nbsp;response&nbsp;comes&nbsp;back, it&nbsp;is&nbsp;addressed&nbsp;to&nbsp;<span style=""font-weight: 600;"">your ephemeral&nbsp;port</span>&nbsp;(49152).Every&nbsp;new&nbsp;outgoing&nbsp;connection&nbsp;uses a new&nbsp;random ephemeral&nbsp;port.<br>"	Ephemeral Ports	aws_vpc Ephemeral Ports
MultipleChoice	Audio::Everything		Why do you need to allow ephemeral ports in NACL outbound rules for HTTP traffic?	Because the client uses a random ephemeral port for the connection	"[ ""Because the client uses a random ephemeral port for the connection"", ""Because HTTP requires multiple ports simultaneously"", ""Because NACLs block all outbound traffic by default"" ]"	When a client connects to a web server on port 80, the server responds using port 80, but the client uses a random ephemeral port (1024-65535) for the connection. Since NACLs are stateless, you must explicitly allow this outbound ephemeral port range.	Ephemeral Ports	aws_vpc Ephemeral Ports
MultipleChoice	Audio::Everything		What traffic cannot be filtered by NACLs?	Amazon DNS, DHCP, instance metadata, and VPC router traffic	"[ ""All internet traffic"", ""Only HTTPS traffic"", ""Amazon DNS, DHCP, instance metadata, and VPC router traffic"" ]"	NACLs cannot filter: Amazon-provided DNS traffic, Amazon DHCP traffic, EC2 instance metadata traffic, or traffic to reserved IP addresses used by the VPC router.	NACLs	aws_vpc NACLs
MultipleChoice	Audio::Everything		How many NACLs can be assigned to a single subnet?	One NACL per subnet	"[ ""Unlimited NACLs"", ""One NACL per subnet"", ""Up to 5 NACLs per subnet"" ]"	You can assign exactly one NACL per subnet. A subnet cannot have more than one NACL, but one NACL can be associated with multiple subnets.	NACLs	aws_vpc NACLs
MultipleChoice	Audio::Everything		What is a Security Group in AWS?	A stateful virtual firewall at the resource level	"[ ""A stateful virtual firewall at the resource level"", ""A stateless firewall at the subnet level"", ""A routing mechanism for VPC traffic"" ]"	A Security Group is a stateful virtual firewall that controls traffic allowed to reach and leave resources. They are attached at the EC2 or network interface level (resource level), not the subnet level.	Security Groups	aws_vpc Groups Security
MultipleChoice	Audio::Everything		At what level do Security Groups operate?	Resource level (EC2/ENI level)	"[ ""Subnet level"", ""Resource level (EC2/ENI level)"", ""VPC level"" ]"	Security Groups operate at the resource level (EC2 instance or network interface level), not at the subnet level like NACLs.	Security Groups	aws_vpc Groups Security
MultipleChoice	Audio::Everything		What does stateful mean in the context of Security Groups?	If a request is allowed, the response is automatically allowed	"[ ""Rules must be defined for both directions separately"", ""Only inbound rules are needed"", ""If a request is allowed, the response is automatically allowed"" ]"	Stateful means that if an incoming request is allowed, the outgoing response is automatically allowed (and vice versa). You don't need to create separate rules for request and response traffic.	Security Groups	aws_vpc Groups Security
MultipleChoice	Audio::Everything		What types of rules can you create in a Security Group?	Only allow rules (implicit deny for everything else)	"[ ""Only allow rules (implicit deny for everything else)"", ""Both allow and deny rules"", ""Only deny rules"" ]"	"Security Groups only allow ""allow"" rules. You cannot create deny rules. If traffic is not explicitly allowed, it is implicitly denied."	Security Groups	aws_vpc Groups Security
